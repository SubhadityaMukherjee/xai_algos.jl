## Refs
- This repo is MASSIVELY inspired by quite a few libraries. This means that I have taken code from them and modified it to fit my needs. I have tried to give credit where credit is due, but if I have missed something, please let me know.
- All the code is in Julia. 
- The repositories that are in Python are used for reference and inspiration.
